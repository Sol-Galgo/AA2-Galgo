	    <h1>Dora the Explorer</h1>
		<p>Dora the explorer is a cartoon show featuring Dora
			as the main character as well as her monkey companion, Boots.
			In every puzzle solving adventure that she faces, she never forgets to bring her essential tools. 
			Her backpack filled with random things, and her map in order to navigate all the way to her final destination.
			Along the way, we might even meet some of her close friends. Her cousin Diego,
			Benny the bull, Tico the squirrel, and Isa the iguana, to name a few.
			We also get to meet Swiper in every episode. He likes to steal Dora's things and hides them. Basically just being a hinderance to Dora's adventures.
			Remember kids, SWIPER NO SWIPING!
